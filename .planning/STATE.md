# Project State: OpenClaw

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-25)

**Core value:** Hierarchical AI orchestration with physical isolation — enabling autonomous, secure, multi-agent task execution at scale.
**Current focus:** v1.5 Config Consolidation — Phase 45 ready to plan

## Current Position

Phase: 45 of 49 (Path Resolver + Constants Foundation)
Plan: — (not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-25 — v1.5 roadmap created (5 phases, 10 requirements)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% — Not started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (shipped milestones):**
- v1.0: 10 phases, 25 plans across 7 days
- v1.1: 8 phases, 17 plans in ~5 hours
- v1.2: 7 phases, 14 plans in ~1 day
- v1.3: 11 phases, 19 plans in ~1 day
- v1.4: 6 phases, 16 plans in ~1 day

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (v1.0–v1.4).

Notable for v1.5:
- Cosine similarity conflict detection threshold (0.92) needs empirical tuning — addressed in Phase 49
- `workspace/` path divergence (runtime `data/workspace/.openclaw/` vs code-resolved `OPENCLAW_ROOT/workspace/.openclaw/`) — addressed in Phase 45
- Phase 49 depends on Phase 45 (shares OPENCLAW_ROOT plumbing) but is independent of Phases 46-48

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Human verification pending for live Docker/browser tests (SIGTERM E2E, memory health UI, suggestions UI) — accepted as tech debt per v1.4 audit

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-25
Stopped at: v1.5 roadmap written — ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, REQUIREMENTS.md updated
Resume: Run `/gsd:plan-phase 45` to plan Phase 45
