# Project State: OpenClaw

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-25)

**Core value:** Hierarchical AI orchestration with physical isolation — enabling autonomous, secure, multi-agent task execution at scale.
**Current focus:** v1.5 Config Consolidation — Phase 45 complete, Phase 46 next

## Current Position

Phase: 46 of 49 (Schema Validation + Fail-Fast Startup)
Plan: 1 of ? (Phase 45 complete)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-25 — 45-02 complete: all call sites migrated to config.py, zero duplicated constants remain

Progress: [##░░░░░░░░] 20% — Phase 45 Plans 01/02 done

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (shipped milestones):**
- v1.0: 10 phases, 25 plans across 7 days
- v1.1: 8 phases, 17 plans in ~5 hours
- v1.2: 7 phases, 14 plans in ~1 day
- v1.3: 11 phases, 19 plans in ~1 day
- v1.4: 6 phases, 16 plans in ~1 day

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (v1.0–v1.4).

Notable for v1.5:
- Cosine similarity conflict detection threshold (0.92) needs empirical tuning — addressed in Phase 49
- `workspace/` path divergence (runtime `data/workspace/.openclaw/` vs code-resolved `OPENCLAW_ROOT/workspace/.openclaw/`) — addressed in Phase 45
- Phase 49 depends on Phase 45 (shares OPENCLAW_ROOT plumbing) but is independent of Phases 46-48

**45-01 decisions:**
- get_state_path() and get_snapshot_dir() require project_id — no Optional default, no active-project fallback
- OPENCLAW_STATE_FILE env var takes priority in get_state_path() to align with container entrypoint.sh behavior
- _find_project_root() never uses Path(__file__).parent — resolves to site-packages, not live project root

**45-02 decisions:**
- pool.py init builds defaults dict inline from DEFAULT_POOL_* constants — no separate dict variable needed
- init.py resolves project_id via get_active_project_id() with "default" fallback for path function calls
- soul_renderer.py aliases get_project_root as _find_project_root to minimize diff while aligning to config source

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Human verification pending for live Docker/browser tests (SIGTERM E2E, memory health UI, suggestions UI) — accepted as tech debt per v1.4 audit

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-25
Stopped at: 45-02 complete — all call sites migrated to config.py, CONF-01 and CONF-05 satisfied
Resume: Run `/gsd:execute-plan 46 01` to execute Phase 46 Plan 01 (Schema Validation + Fail-Fast Startup)
